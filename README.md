## Description

OxygenCMS is a CMS built using the CodeIgniter PHP framework. Using an MVC architecture it was built with modularity in mind. Lightweight, themeable and dynamic. Its main feature is the built in Ecommerce module
that can be extended up to enterprise level.

OxygenCMS has been built from powerful web technologies such as, PHP5 (OO), CodeIgniter, and extended from PyroCMS Core (CI Edition), Streams. We believe our product will enable your business to maintain growth during development and lower the cost of learning, and upgrading your platform.
